# Project Description

This project aims to create a recommendation system for the best hospitals in the United States using a tree structure. The data for hospital performance and ratings will be obtained from various sources, including Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Hospital Compare website, U.S. News & World Report Best Hospitals Rankings, Leapfrog Hospital Safety Grade, Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS), The Joint Commission, American Hospital Association, National Quality Forum, and Healthcare Quality and Improvement.

# Required Python Packages
The following Python packages are required to run the project:

pandas: To handle data processing and manipulation.
sklearn: To build and train the decision tree model.
matplotlib: To visualize the decision tree.

# How to Run the Code
Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine.
Install the required Python packages using pip or conda package manager.
Open the main.py file, which contains the Python code for the project.
Run the main.py file using a Python interpreter or an integrated development environment (IDE) of your choice.
The program will fetch data from the various sources, process it, build a decision tree model, and generate recommendations for the best hospitals in the US based on the tree structure.
The recommendations will be displayed on the console or visualized using matplotlib, as per the implementation.

# Data Structure 

The data used in the project is organized and stored in a structured format, primarily as pandas DataFrames, which are a popular data manipulation library in Python. DataFrames are two-dimensional tabular data structures with labeled axes (rows and columns) that allow for efficient data manipulation and analysis.
The project utilizes multiple DataFrames to store and organize different aspects of the hospital performance data. The main DataFrames used in the project include:
1.	hospital_data: This DataFrame contains information about each hospital, such as hospital name, location, ownership type, hospital type, and services offered. It is used as the primary reference DataFrame for hospital-specific information.
2.	performance_data: This DataFrame contains performance measures for each hospital, such as overall hospital rating, patient satisfaction scores, readmission rates, and mortality rates. It is linked to the hospital_data DataFrame using a unique hospital identifier, allowing for easy merging and analysis of performance measures by hospital.
3.	comparison_data: This DataFrame is generated by aggregating and summarizing data from the hospital_data and performance_data DataFrames. It provides overall statistics and performance comparisons across different categories, such as hospital type, ownership type, and geographic location.
4.	geospatial_data: This DataFrame contains geographic information, such as latitude and longitude, for each hospital. It is used for generating visualizations and conducting geospatial analysis.
