Project Description

This project aims to create a recommendation system for the best hospitals in the United States using a tree structure. The data for hospital performance and ratings will be obtained from various sources, including Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Hospital Compare website, U.S. News & World Report Best Hospitals Rankings, Leapfrog Hospital Safety Grade, Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS), The Joint Commission, American Hospital Association, National Quality Forum, and Healthcare Quality and Improvement.

Required Python Packages
The following Python packages are required to run the project:

pandas: To handle data processing and manipulation.
sklearn: To build and train the decision tree model.
matplotlib: To visualize the decision tree.

How to Run the Code
Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine.
Install the required Python packages using pip or conda package manager.
Open the main.py file, which contains the Python code for the project.
Make sure to replace the API keys or access tokens in the code, if required, for accessing the data sources.
Run the main.py file using a Python interpreter or an integrated development environment (IDE) of your choice.
The program will fetch data from the various sources, process it, build a decision tree model, and generate recommendations for the best hospitals in the US based on the tree structure.
The recommendations will be displayed on the console or visualized using matplotlib, as per the implementation.
